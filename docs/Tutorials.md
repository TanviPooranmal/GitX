Welcome to the GitX Tutorials section! These tutorials are designed to help you get hands-on experience with GitX, covering a variety of topics from basic operations to advanced workflows. Follow along with these step-by-step guides to become proficient in using GitX.

## Setting Up Your First GitX Repository

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up and initialize your first GitX repository.

### Step 1: Install GitX

Ensure you have GitX installed on your machine. Follow the [Installation Guide](/Getting_Started.html#installation-guide) if you haven't installed it yet.

### Step 2: Initialize a New Repository

Navigate to your project directory and initialize a new GitX repository.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
gitx init
```

### Step 3: Add Files to Your Repository

Add your project files to the staging area.

```bash
gitx add .
```

### Step 4: Commit Your Changes

Commit the staged files to the repository with a message.

```bash
gitx commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Step 5: View Commit History

Check the commit history to confirm your changes.

```bash
gitx log
```

## Collaborating with Others

This tutorial covers how to collaborate with other developers using GitX.

### Step 1: Clone a Repository

Clone the repository you want to contribute to.

```bash
gitx clone <repository-url>
```

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your work.

```bash
gitx branch <feature-branch>
gitx checkout <feature-branch>
```

### Step 3: Make and Commit Changes

Make your changes and commit them.

```bash
gitx add <changed-files>
gitx commit -m "Description of changes"
```

### Step 4: Push Your Changes

Push your changes to the remote repository.

```bash
gitx push origin <feature-branch>
```

### Step 5: Create a Pull Request

Create a pull request on the repository's hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) for your changes to be reviewed and merged.

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

Learn how to handle and resolve merge conflicts in this tutorial.

### Step 1: Simulate a Merge Conflict

Create a conflict by modifying the same line of a file in two different branches.

### Step 2: Attempt to Merge

Attempt to merge the branches.

```bash
gitx checkout main
gitx merge <conflicting-branch>
```

### Step 3: Resolve Conflicts

GitX will notify you of conflicts. Open the conflicting files and resolve the conflicts manually.

### Step 4: Add Resolved Files

After resolving the conflicts, add the resolved files to the staging area.

```bash
gitx add <resolved-files>
```

### Step 5: Commit the Merge

Commit the merge with a message.

```bash
gitx commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```

## 4. Using GitX with Remote Repositories

This tutorial shows you how to use GitX to interact with remote repositories.

### Step 1: Add a Remote Repository

Add a remote repository to your GitX project.

```bash
gitx remote add origin <repository-url>
```

### Step 2: Fetch Changes

Fetch changes from the remote repository without merging them.

```bash
gitx fetch
```

### Step 3: Pull Changes

Pull changes from the remote repository and merge them into your current branch.

```bash
gitx pull origin main
```

### Step 4: Push Changes

Push your local commits to the remote repository.

```bash
gitx push origin main
```

## 5. Advanced Branching and Rebasing (currently under development)

Explore advanced branching and rebasing techniques with GitX.

### Step 1: Create a Feature Branch

Create a feature branch from the main branch.

```bash
gitx checkout -b feature-branch
```

### Step 2: Rebase Your Feature Branch

Rebase your feature branch onto the latest main branch.

```bash
gitx checkout main
gitx pull origin main
gitx checkout feature-branch
gitx rebase main
```

### Step 3: Resolve Any Conflicts

If there are conflicts, resolve them as shown in the merge conflict tutorial.

### Step 4: Continue Rebase

After resolving conflicts, continue the rebase process.

```bash
gitx rebase --continue
```

### Step 5: Push Your Rebases

Push your rebased feature branch to the remote repository.

```bash
gitx push -f origin feature-branch
```
