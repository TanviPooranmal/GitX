## Welcome to GitX

Hello and welcome to the project page of GitX, a new and innovative version control system (VCS) designed with compatibility in mind.

### What is GitX?

GitX is not just another VCS, it’s a system built from the ground up to be compatible with one of the most popular and widely used version control systems in the world - Git. Our goal with GitX is to provide a seamless experience for developers who are already familiar with Git, while also introducing new features and improvements that make version control even more efficient and user-friendly.

### Why GitX?

In the world of software development, change is the only constant. Codebases evolve over time, with new features being added, bugs being fixed, and old features being removed or refactored. Managing these changes can be a complex task, especially for large projects with many contributors. That’s where a VCS like GitX comes in.

GitX helps you manage changes to your project without the fear of breaking things. It keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

We’re excited to have you on this journey with us. Explore the project, try out GitX, and let us know what you think. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us make GitX the best version control system it can be.

#### Welcome to GitX - we can’t wait to see what you’ll create!

## Features and Benefits

### 1. Compatibility with Git:

One of the key features of GitX is its compatibility with **Git**. This means that if you’re a developer who’s already familiar with Git, you’ll feel right at home with GitX. All the commands, features, and workflows that you’re used to will work just as expected.

### 2. Detailed Documentation
GitX provides comprehensive and easy-to-understand documentation. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, you’ll find the help you need to make the most of GitX.

### 3. Open Source
GitX is open source. This means you can see exactly how it works, contribute to its development, and even modify it to suit your needs. It’s developed in the open, with transparency and community involvement at its core.

## System Requirements

### Operating System: 

GitX is engineered to be platform-agnostic and is compatible with contemporary operating systems including, but not limited to, Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and various distributions of Linux.

### Hardware Specifications: 
- **Processor**: A minimum of 1 GHz processing speed is recommended for optimal performance.
- **Memory**: At least 1 GB of RAM is suggested to ensure smooth operation.
- **Storage**: A minimum of 300 MB of disk space is required for the installation of GitX. Additional storage will be necessary for the repositories managed by GitX.

### Software Requirements:
- **Go Programming Language**: GitX is developed using Go. Therefore, to build the project from the source code, the Go compiler (version 1.16 or later) is required.
- **Git**: GitX is designed to be compatible with Git. Having Git installed on your system will enable the utilization of Git commands within GitX.
