Welcome to the GitX User Guide! This guide will help you understand the basics of using GitX, including commands, branching, merging, and more. Let's get started.

## 1. Basic Commands

In this section, you'll learn about the fundamental commands needed to use GitX effectively.

### Initializing a Repository

To start using GitX, you need to initialize a repository.

```bash
gitx init <repo-name>
```

### Cloning a Repository

Clone an existing repository to your local machine.

```bash
gitx clone <repository-url>
```

### Checking Status

Check the status of your working directory and staging area.

```bash
gitx status
```

### Adding Changes

Add changes to the staging area.

```bash
gitx add <file-pattern>
```

### Committing Changes

Commit the staged changes to the repository.

```bash
gitx commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Viewing Commit History

View the commit history of the repository.

```bash
gitx log
```

## 2. Branching and Merging

Branching and merging are essential features of GitX that allow for parallel development and integration.

### Creating a Branch

Create a new branch to work on a specific feature or bug fix.

```bash
gitx branch create <branch-name>
```

### Switching Branches

Switch to another branch to start working on it.

```bash
gitx branch switch <branch-name>
```

### Merging Branches

Merge changes from one branch into another.

```bash
gitx merge <branch-name>
```

### Resolving Conflicts

Sometimes merging can result in conflicts. GitX will guide you through resolving them.

```bash
# Edit conflicting files to resolve conflicts
gitx add <resolved-file>
gitx commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```

## 3. Distributed Version Control System (currently under develoment)

GitX supports a distributed version control system, allowing multiple collaborators to work on the same project.

### Fetching Updates

Fetch updates from a remote repository without merging.

```bash
gitx fetch
```

### Pulling Changes

Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.

```bash
gitx pull
```

### Pushing Changes

Push your local commits to a remote repository.

```bash
gitx push <remote-name> <branch-name>
```

### Managing Remotes

Add or remove remote repositories.

```bash
# Add a remote
gitx remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>

# Remove a remote
gitx remote remove <remote-name>
```

## 4. Advanced Features (currently under development)

The advanced features of GitX are still under development. Here is a sneak peek of what to expect:

### Interactive Rebase

Rebase your commits interactively for a cleaner history.

```bash
gitx rebase -i <commit-hash>
```

### Stashing Changes

Save your changes temporarily without committing them.

```bash
gitx stash
```

### Applying Stashes

Apply stashed changes back to your working directory.

```bash
gitx stash apply
```

### Submodules

Manage submodules within your repository.

```bash
gitx submodule add <repository-url> <path>
```
