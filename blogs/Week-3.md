# Week 3: Implementing Diff, Git Diff, Branching and Merging in GitX

In the third week of developing GitX, our lightweight version control system, we focused on implementing the `diff` and `git diff` commands. These commands are essential for comparing changes between different versions of a file.

## Understanding the Diff Algorithm

To implement the `diff` command, we explored the diff algorithm developed by Eugene W. Myers. This algorithm efficiently finds the differences between two files and represents them in a human-readable format.

## Leveraging the go-diff Library

To simplify our implementation, we utilized the `go-diff` library, which provides a set of functions and data structures for performing diffs in Go. This library helped us handle the complexities of the diff algorithm and allowed us to focus on integrating it into GitX.

## Emphasizing Readable and Modular Project Structure

Throughout the week, we emphasized the importance of maintaining a readable and modular project structure. By organizing our code into logical modules and following best practices, we ensured that our implementation of GitX remains maintainable and scalable.

## Implementing Git Branching in GitX

In addition to implementing the `diff` and `git diff` commands, we also learned about the power of Git branching during the third week of developing GitX.

### Understanding Git Branching

Git branching allows us to create separate lines of development within a Git repository. Each branch represents an independent line of work, enabling us to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other.

### Exploring Git Merging

We also delved into the concept of Git merging, which allows us to combine changes from different branches into a single branch. This is useful when we want to incorporate the changes made in a feature branch back into the main branch of our project.

### Understanding Git Algorithms

During our exploration of Git branching and merging, we also learned about the underlying algorithms that Git uses to handle these operations. Understanding these algorithms helps us make informed decisions when resolving conflicts and managing our Git repository.

## Conclusion

In week 3, we made significant progress in implementing the `diff` and `git diff` commands in GitX. By leveraging the diff algorithm by Eugene W. Myers and the go-diff library, we were able to efficiently compare file versions. Additionally, our focus on project structure ensured that our code remains readable and modular.

Stay tuned for more updates on the development of GitX in the coming weeks!
