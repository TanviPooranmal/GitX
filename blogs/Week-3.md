# Week 3: Implementing Diff and Mastering Git Features in GitX

In the third week of developing GitX, our lightweight version control system, we focused on implementing the `diff` and `git diff` commands. These commands are essential for comparing changes between different versions of a file.

## Understanding the Diff Algorithm

To implement the `diff` command, we explored the diff algorithm developed by Eugene W. Myers. This algorithm efficiently finds the differences between two files and represents them in a human-readable format.

## Leveraging the go-diff Library

To simplify our implementation, we utilized the `go-diff` library, which provides a set of functions and data structures for performing diffs in Go. This library helped us handle the complexities of the diff algorithm and allowed us to focus on integrating it into GitX.

## Emphasizing Readable and Modular Project Structure

Throughout the week, we emphasized the importance of maintaining a readable and modular project structure. By organizing our code into logical modules and following best practices, we ensured that our implementation of GitX remains maintainable and scalable.

## Implementing Git Branching in GitX

In addition to implementing the `diff` and `git diff` commands, we also learned about the power of Git branching during the third week of developing GitX.

### Understanding Git Branching

Git branching allows us to create separate lines of development within a Git repository. Each branch represents an independent line of work, enabling us to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other.

### Exploring Git Merging

We also delved into the concept of Git merging, which allows us to combine changes from different branches into a single branch. This is useful when we want to incorporate the changes made in a feature branch back into the main branch of our project.

### Understanding Git Algorithms

During our exploration of Git branching and merging, we also learned about the underlying algorithms that Git uses to handle these operations. Understanding these algorithms helps us make informed decisions when resolving conflicts and managing our Git repository.

## Understanding Git Squash and Stash

During the third week of developing GitX, we also explored two important Git features: squash and stash.

### Git Squash

Git squash is a powerful feature that allows us to combine multiple commits into a single commit. This is useful when we want to condense a series of small, incremental commits into a more cohesive and meaningful commit. Squashing commits helps keep our commit history clean and organized, making it easier to understand the changes made to the codebase.

To squash commits, we can use the `git rebase` command with the interactive mode. This allows us to choose which commits to squash and how to combine them. By following the interactive rebase process, we can effectively squash multiple commits into one.

### Git Stash

Git stash is another useful feature that allows us to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed. This is particularly helpful when we need to switch to a different branch or work on a different task without committing incomplete changes.

To stash changes, we can use the `git stash` command. This command saves the current changes in a temporary area, allowing us to revert back to the clean state of the branch. Later, we can apply the stashed changes back to the branch using the `git stash apply` or `git stash pop` command.

Both Git squash and stash are powerful tools that enhance our workflow and provide flexibility in managing our code changes. By understanding and utilizing these features, we can maintain a clean commit history and effectively manage our work in GitX.

## Conclusion

In week 3, we made significant progress in implementing the `diff` and `git diff` commands in GitX. By leveraging the diff algorithm by Eugene W. Myers and the go-diff library, we were able to efficiently compare file versions. Additionally, our focus on project structure ensured that our code remains readable and modular.

We also learned about the power of Git branching and merging during this week. Git branching allows us to create separate lines of development within a Git repository, enabling us to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other. Git merging, on the other hand, allows us to combine changes from different branches into a single branch, making it easier to incorporate changes made in a feature branch back into the main branch of our project.

Furthermore, we explored two important Git features: squash and stash. Git squash is a powerful feature that allows us to combine multiple commits into a single commit, helping us maintain a clean and organized commit history. To squash commits, we can use the `git rebase` command with the interactive mode. This allows us to choose which commits to squash and how to combine them.

Git stash, on the other hand, allows us to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed. This is particularly useful when we need to switch to a different branch or work on a different task without committing incomplete changes. To stash changes, we can use the `git stash` command, and later apply the stashed changes back to the branch using the `git stash apply` or `git stash pop` command.

By understanding and utilizing these Git features, we can enhance our workflow, maintain a clean commit history, and effectively manage our work in GitX.
