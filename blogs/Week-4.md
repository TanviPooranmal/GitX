# Week 4: Exploring GitX Features

In this week's development of GitX, a lightweight VCS inspired by Git, we will take a high-level look at some important GitX features. While we won't dive into the technical details of what's happening behind the scenes, we'll provide a brief overview of the functionalities.

## GitX Commands

### cat-file

The `cat-file` command in GitX allows you to view the contents of a specific object in the repository. It can be useful for inspecting the contents of blobs, trees, commits, and tags.

### cherry-picking

Cherry-picking is a powerful feature in GitX that allows you to apply the changes from a specific commit onto another branch. It's a handy way to selectively apply changes without merging entire branches.

### ls reflog

The `ls reflog` command displays the reference logs, which keep track of changes to the repository's references (e.g., branches, tags). It can be helpful for understanding the history of reference updates.

### log

The `log` command in GitX shows the commit history of the repository. It displays information such as commit messages, authors, dates, and commit hashes. It's a useful command for tracking changes and understanding the project's evolution.

### ls file

The `ls file` command allows you to list the files in a specific commit or tree. It can be handy for inspecting the contents of a particular snapshot in the repository's history.

## GitX Configuration

Apart from the command-line tools, GitX also provides configuration options to customize your workflow. The `git-config` files allow you to set various settings, such as user information, default branch, and merge strategies.

## Collaboration with GitX

GitX supports essential collaboration features like `git push` and `git pull`. These commands enable you to share your changes with others by pushing them to a remote repository or pulling changes from a remote repository into your local copy.

That wraps up our high-level overview of some key features in GitX for Week 4. While we didn't delve into the technical details, we hope this provides a good starting point for exploring these functionalities further.

Stay tuned for more updates on the development of GitX!
