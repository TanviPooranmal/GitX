# Week 1: Introduction to GitX and Version Control Systems

In the first week of building our project GitX, a lightweight VCS inspired by Git, we focused on getting familiar with the fundamental concepts and tools that will be essential throughout the development process.

## Introduction to Git, GitHub, and Go

To lay a solid foundation, we started by introducing Git, GitHub, and the Go programming language (Golang). Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and offers additional collaboration features. Golang, with its simplicity, performance, and strong support for concurrency, is an excellent choice for building a lightweight VCS like GitX.

## Understanding Version Control Systems

We delved into the core concepts of version control systems (VCS) and their importance in software development. VCS allows us to track changes made to files over time, collaborate with other developers, and easily revert to previous versions if needed. We discussed the benefits of using VCS and how it can streamline the development process.

## Exploring Git Commands and Go Programming

During the first week, we also covered some common Git commands that will be essential for managing our GitX project. These commands include `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`, among others. Additionally, we utilized the Go programming language to write programs and gain hands-on experience with coding.

## Inflating and Deflating Content

One of the key aspects of VCS is the ability to store and manage file content efficiently. We learned about the concepts of inflating and deflating content, which involve compressing and decompressing data to optimize storage and transmission. This knowledge will be crucial in implementing the underlying mechanisms of GitX.

## Understanding the Git Workspace

Finally, we explored the concept of the Git workspace, which consists of three main components: the working directory, the staging area, and the repository. We discussed how changes made to files are tracked and organized within these components, enabling developers to manage their code effectively.

## Conclusion

The first week of our GitX project was dedicated to building a strong foundation in Git, GitHub, Golang, and VCS concepts. We gained a solid understanding of how version control systems work and explored the fundamental tools and techniques that will be essential in the development of GitX.

Stay tuned for the next blog post, where we will dive deeper into the implementation details of GitX and start building the core functionalities!
