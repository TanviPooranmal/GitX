# Week 5: Implementing GitX

In this week's blog entry, I will be sharing my progress on implementing GitX, a lightweight version control system inspired by Git. Under the guidance of my mentor, I have been diving deep into the code work, focusing primarily on the implementation aspect.

Throughout the week, I have been working diligently to understand the core concepts of version control systems and how they are implemented in Git. This knowledge has been crucial in shaping the design and architecture of GitX.

One of the key milestones achieved during this week was setting up the basic structure of GitX. I have created the necessary classes and modules to handle repository creation, file tracking, and commit management. This foundation will serve as the backbone for the entire system.

Additionally, I have started working on the core functionalities of GitX, such as branching, merging, and diffing. These features are essential for any version control system and will greatly enhance the usability and flexibility of GitX.

While implementing GitX, I have encountered various challenges and roadblocks. However, with the support and guidance of my mentor, I have been able to overcome these obstacles and make steady progress. The experience of troubleshooting and debugging has been invaluable in honing my problem-solving skills.

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue working on GitX and further refine its features. In the upcoming weeks, I plan to focus on enhancing the user interface, improving performance, and implementing additional advanced functionalities.

Stay tuned for more updates on my GitX journey in the next blog entry!
